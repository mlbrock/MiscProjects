	Symptoms    :

		The elite weapon 'Ogre Axe' (code 7o7) is picked up but not identified
		(just stashed). This is being done both by SnagIt/BMItems and by my ISF,
		which are to entirely different code bases --- they share NO common code.

		Problem seems to manifest itself as follows:

			1) Ogre Axes are picked up by code 707 because they qualify as
				elite weapons. The idea is that such weapons will be identified
				at some other point in the bot cycle to determine if they are
				Cruel (or have some other interesting modifier).

				Note that the pickup is by item code only. Item class should be
				implied by the code.

			2) At the identification stage of the bot cycle, the code looks for
				items to be processed. Ogre Axes in the inventory which are
				not identified would be candidates, except for the fact that
				their item class is undefined. So they're just stashed.

		Why does this happen? I think the answer is as follows:

		The MPQ entry for item code '7o7' ('Ogre Axe') has the following norm,
		ultra, and uber codes: 'bar', '9b7', and '7b7'. It's own code ('7o7',
		which I've confirmed in-game) is not included in the list. Adding to the
		confusion is the fact that '7b7' is actually the item code for 'Champion
		Axe'.

		It seems likely that the in-game/in-core determination of item class is
		performed by comparison of the item code against the norm, ultra, and
		uber codes. If the MPQ data is used for this comparison, it will
		never match for Ogre Axes.

		So the problem is most likely the result of SnagIt (and, in my case, ISF)
		picking up Ogre Axes (because they're elite weapons as specified in the
		INI), but they aren't being matched by a BMItems.ini (ISF) entry when it
		comes time to ID stuff because it's item class is not elite.

		To test with this script, you'll need an Ogre Axe of course...
